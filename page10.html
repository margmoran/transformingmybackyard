  <meta name="description" content="At the beginning of the project I had a number of ideas I was keen to develop into a project so I was able to make a good start. Even coming up with the questions which helped me to plan out my backyard design project was pretty straightforward. The next stage of finding suitable information proved more difficult.  Although finding out some information was fairly simple I had no idea there were so many designs I could look at nor so many plants I could choose from.  Trying to find really good garden designs which suited my priorities was again time consuming and often confusing.  Speaking with an expert helped me to narrow my focus and therefore my research which was getting out of control.
â€‹
I have experimented a bit with note-taking during the research of this project. I have tried colour coding, tables and also dot points under headings and come to the conclusion that for me I prefer to have a clear question I am looking for information about and to write dot points under that question. Tables with copied internet material in columns works well but I like to get rid of that copied material after I have finished to reduce the size of the notes, leaving only the Bibliographical reference next to the note.
 
I really enjoyed the challenge of creating the website and felt a certain satisfaction with the professional presentation of my information. It was also great to work on the development of skills I am likely to use for other tasks.
 
I found it more meaningful to actually have a practical outcome for this project; that I will see a newly designed garden at the end. I am looking forward to seeing if the plants I have chosen do thrive as well as what changes I may need to make.
 
Much of the work for this project required me to set goals for each double period. My productivity during class time varied from week to week and was influenced by who I was sitting with and sometimes the mood I was in. At home I managed to get a lot done when I could spend at least an hour without interruptions.  I found talking to friends and teachers helped with problem solving but often I could work out solutions to issues on my own. I know I prefer quiet for working(rather than music on) and try to sit where I am not looking at someone but more out a window to maximise being productive.">
